# Euler Project

## Usual disclaimer
It is strongly NOT recommended to steal solutions from the internet for the Euler Project. I will (hopefully) have all the first 100 problems solved there, since sharing solution for problems after number 100 strongly discouraged.

## Progress
01/10/2023: 1 to 23 done

## Why ?
I had too much time on my hands while looking for a PhD (that my future me has hopefully found), so I decided to have a serious go at the Euler Project.

## Why `rust`?
I learned `python` by learning how to code simple algorithms and data structures, so rinse and repeat.
I also thought it was a good warmup in `rust`, while I wait for the real trial by fire (Advent of Code 2023).
